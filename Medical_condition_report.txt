Complete Process :- 

1. In a first step, I have cleaned the data and replaced characters with suitable strings.
2. Added the necessary columns such as health status on the basis of BMI score and age range on the   
   basis of age criteria of patients.
3. Created a pivot table and designed a dashboard on basis of which key insights generated are 
   mentioned below with recommendations.




bmi		health_status
0-18.5		Underweight
18.5-24.9	Heavyweight
25.0-29.9	Overweight
30-34.9		Class 1 Obesity
35.0-39.9	Class 2 Obesity
40.0 >          Class 3 Obesity


age	age	age_range
0-16	0	child
17-30	17	young
31-45	31	middle age
45>	45	old age
